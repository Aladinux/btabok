IASA - ITABoK

The art of becoming a well architected organization forms the basis for our change focus and our ability to derive value from our strategic planning and capabilities. To become is to grow in a healthy and positive way and that must be the focus of the architecture team. Also to become we must have something we want or need to be to succeed in the world. This envisioning and changing serves as the fundamental differentiator for the Iasa engagement model. Iasa architects and architecture teams have something they want to become which is not simply a reiteration of the words of a ‘business person’. We are change agents, become agents, and have a target state always in mind.

For the ITABoK there is a limit to the architects responsibility and job (see Our Mission is Digital First Everything Else Second). We focus our becoming on scoped initiatives which can aid in the acquisition of identified and measured value within the timeframe and reach of the architecture initiative.

## Understanding the Digital Business

A digital business is not just a digitized business. The goal of digital is to fundamentally rethink the relationship between technology and the customer/citizen/stakeholder. For example, in many daily transactions in banking the mobile application has fundamentally replaced the banking branch. This transition could be described as operational efficiency but would better be described as technology fundamentally altering the customer relationship to positive and profitable outcomes. Many banks treat the mobile application as a part of ‘the business’ instead of ‘IT’ but digital transformation requires such a deep understanding of technology’s impact during every single customer interaction that IT has to become ‘the business’. This business leadership role has become the most critically important capability an organization can develop but it requires that technologists in the company function in a fundamentally different way.

Digital Businesses are those that have transformed their processes, hierarchy, outcomes and investments to consider technology as an equal player to sales, operations, marketing, investment, and strategy. That technical expertise is not seen as a back of the house operations problem but a fundamentally equivalent investment and planning capability and that the organization has enacted this in every level, event and process the company runs. This transformation starts with the hearts and minds of the employees, managers and executives that lead the company. It is delivered through architecture led digital strategy and delivery. (See ADDT).

Introduction

As we understand how digital systems work within existing or new business models, they take shape with a specific vision and scope. We change certain technology strategies and certain business processes in ways that impact the ecosystem of customers, the involvement of our customer experience, and their journey with our company. The architect applies envisioning and goal-setting techniques to define the business case for a new solution and assesses our alternatives. (Source : Wikipedia)

This section of the ITaBOK will present how digital business can be transformed from a traditional business using Digital Transformation Framework. A digital platform helps in providing a repository for different business departments in the organization to perform tasks and share data. This platform helps in creating product and service offerings to the customer. Customers can use the platform to personalize the product and service for ordering them online or for in-person service.

Description

## **Digital Transformation Framework**

Traditional businesses need to create a digital business transformation strategy that helps them to coordinate across inventory, accounting, marketing, sales, finance, customer support, design, supplier management, and shipping departments in the business value chain. The data is generated in a business related to customer, vendor, partner, product, and employees. The digital business platform helps the business to coordinate and perform business with the enterprise.

Digital Transformation strategy consists of three components mentioned below:

Business Strategy

Business Architecture

Business Process

Digital Transformation touches upon three important areas in a business which are listed below:

Customer Experience

Operational Process

Business Model

### **Customer Experience**

Customer Experience Area has the fundamental units related to customer understanding, Business growth and customer touch-points. Product and service brands are promoted using digital channels. Loyalty point programs are created for customers who are interacting with digital enterprise applications. The sales team interacts with the customer for purchases, transactions, clarifications and provide better customer experience. Customer transactions are used for personalization and providing product or service packages. Customer is having better experience using the digital platform. The online shopping experience is improved using the customer clickstream analysis. The shopping process is improved to help customers and increase their engagement. Customers can choose home delivery, drive-through, and pickup options using the digital applications.

Digital initiatives are taken by the enterprise for improving customer service. The list of digital initiatives is shown below:

Customer trust improves with fast and transparent problem resolution.

Multi-Channel integrated experience is provided to the customer.

Crowd Sourcing with the company’s employees and customers

### **Operational Process**

Operational Process Area consists of the following areas:

Process digitization

Worker enablement

Performance management.

Process automation

The processes which are targeted for automation are related to finance, manufacturing, customer transactions and supply-side areas in the enterprises. Digital platform helps in product design and development. This helps in design meeting the time to market. Employees collaborate using email, video conference, web conference, and chat tools. They can interact with different geographies and save travel costs. Mobile channel is used for collaboration between employees in the working hours and off-time hours. The digital platform enables employee-workplace decoupling and many of the employees can increase productivity working remotely from home and office seamlessly. Globalization is happening because of the collaboration tools where employees can operate in a distributed team. They can collaborate and work during the off time in different timezones.

Vertical and Horizontal channels are provided by the digital platform. CXOs and VPs can communicate very fast in an enterprise with employees and customers. The collaboration tools help in cutting down costs and also improve knowledge sharing. Sales can collaborate with engineering using collaborative tools effectively to improve revenue. Performance transparency is another key feature of the digital platform in the companies. Employees can make quick decisions using the digital tools of the platform. The employees have access to transactional applications that provide access to customers, partners, products, and processes. Front office and back-office processes are improved to provide access to transactional applications. Executives and managers can get status from different geographies and distributed systems. Digital platforms help in quick and well-thought decision making.

### **Business Model**

The business Model area has building blocks for the below areas:

Digital business

Digital globalization

New business models

Digital business provides new service and product offerings in addition to physical offerings. The digital business platform can provide content to different departments of the business. The traditional products can be enhanced to digital offerings and the business models need to be reshaped accordingly.

The technology plays an important role in the digital business for integrating systems with various enterprise applications. The data which is in a repository helps in improving efficiencies in the business. Data centralization helps in faster decision making and customizing business to the specific requirements.

### **Digital Capabilities**

There are three pillars in Digital platform and digital capabilities cut through the following

Customer Experience

Operational Processes

Business Models

CxOs and IT employees are handling digital initiatives in the enterprise and the team needs to be trained for new skills. New IT departments are to be created for digital transformation strategy. The departments in the enterprise have the applications, data dictionaries, and business processes specific to the department. The goal is to provide a common view to all the departments related to master data such as products, partners, vendors, and employees. The common view helps in improving customer engagement and optimizing the process.

Multi-Channel operations are provided by the digital platform. The transactions need to be aggregated from various channels to provide the analytics and for quick decision making. Globalization can be achieved easily by having a multichannel digital platform. Digital maturity is measured by digital and transformation management intensity dimensions. Digital intensity is based on initiatives such as customer engagement, business operations, and business model dimensions. The transformation management intensity is based on capabilities like vision, governance, engagement and IT-Business relationships.

Perspective

Different approaches to digital transformation are Linear and Exponential transformation. The digital linear transformation approach is based on the improvement of capabilities over the current state. The business model remains as it is. Exponential digital transformation initiatives impact the business model to evolve. The exponential transformation impacts the leadership, people, product, process, customer, channel, and pricing.

In practice

Digital Transformation is implemented to improve customer, employee, and partner User experience. The operational, product and customer insights can be monetized. The analytic profiles based on customers, products, employees, and channels can be created. The business process can be optimized for applying analytics. Data Exhaust can be captured in the digital platform. The business value chain has processes related to design, procurement, inventory, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and support which can be digitalized.

## Here’s how to do it. Here’s a card/tool/canvas – how long does it take, what skills or pre-knowledge are required?

Cards and Canvases will be added in a separate presentation.

## What are the pitfalls?

The typical pitfalls in digital transformation framework are listed below:

Digital business ROI is not estimated before implementing

Digital ecosystems are overlooked during the digital strategy execution

Digital disruption magnitude and pace are not understood before the start of the digital transformation initiatives.

Change is resisted by the organization during the digital transformation

Experts and skilled resources are not present during the digital strategy execution

Digital Transformation is understood as one time process but it is a continuing initiative.

For increased maturity

Digital maturity is measured and used for categorization of the :

Beginner

Fashionista

Conservative

Digerati

Fashionista companies try to change the way they operate using digital technology. Digital Transformation strategy is not based on the business benefits. They do not have governance to execute the digital transformation strategy. Digital Conservatives execute the digital transformation with great vision, governance, and corporate culture. Digerati companies execute the digital transformation strategy focusing on business value and benefits. Digital culture is encouraged and is implemented. Digerati have a competitive edge over their competitors because of digital platforms enriched with great features.
