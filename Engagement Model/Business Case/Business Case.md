*Generally, all articles should be 2-4 pages in length of 12-point text not including images.* *Write up one method which works, not all possible methods (can refer by link to others). IASA is not prescriptive and only provides a framework and suggestions from best/better practice which are known to work well. Other methods may be substituted in the organization’s own practice and culture of architecture. For the architect, we are interested in showcasing rapid techniques which illustrate how to get things done and communicate (vice paralysis or cult-following).*
