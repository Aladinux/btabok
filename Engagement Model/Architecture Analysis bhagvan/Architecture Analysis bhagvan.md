A good tool to use that is part of the emerging suite of question-based patterns is the;

-   Perspectives-Based Architectural Analysis Methodology (PBAAM).

This structured set of questions can be used to review your architecture and sure it is aligned with;

-   The organizational structure and business imperatives, and
    -   That the solution will land in the field, be adopted and can be supported.

Another tool that can be used is the

This is a formal process and structure that works well for big projects and large teams.
