The goal is to create an BT architecture competency guidebook based on a people-first approach that conveys best practices and learning objectives at each level of architectural growth. This guidebook will also assist hiring managers, business managers and human resource representatives.

As you digest the BTABoK competencies we ask that you realize that while this knowledge base has existed for many years, and has undergone countless upgrades and discussions, that this is the first time it has been published in this format. As such, we are ACTIVELY SEEKING to get your constructive feedback so that we can get it fully normalized and edited. We understand that some of our readers will not agree with all of the content and we want your feedback, but simple negative comments will be rejected.
