# Please Save Me From Dumb Requirements - Design Part 4

There is a scene in Fight Club where the main actor is sitting in a meeting with his boss and a software vendor. No one remembers the content of the meeting because it is just background. But the boss' favorite color is cornflower blue ('he's wearing his cornflower blue tie again'). The meeting continues with the boss asking the vendor if he can get all the user-interface buttons in, yep, cornflower blue. This is the epitome of useless requirements. Oh we have been trained that 'the business' defines the requirements it needs, but experience tells us there are a LOT of cornflower blue buttons being built with the companies money. 

As an architect in the middle of design, requirements stitch together the outcome of the system with it's purpose. UI design requirements, quality attribute requirements, constraints, business functionality, all the desires and wants that great systems represent. Sometimes they are specific and sometimes they are general, but ultimately they form the basis for what is delivered, configured or designed. 

And yet requirements are an utter mess. 

In fact, I often describe great architecture as

> "making great business technology decisions, at the right velocity, in complex ecosystems with a complex set of stakeholders."

But what makes a decision great or even architectural? And if this is so important why do we not do a better job of it?

If you haven’t read the BTABoK article and Part 1, you may want to familiarize yourself with those first. Always keep in mind the BTABoK is open source. If you don’t like the article, change it however you want and do a pull request, and the editorial team will review and accept/reject it. Also, we are shamelessly looking for volunteers for special BTABoK projects, like the Pattern Library

## Conclusion

Well I hope this helps in terms of using the BTABoK for referencing architecture decisions. This is one of my most passionate topic areas and should be on the MUST DO list of any architecture practice. We cannot provide value if we don't know how we make decisions!

In a somewhat backwards way, I started with decisions and will be working to a requirements and objectives article next because I want to show the contextual nature of architecture and how changing decisions can change requirements.

You can find all of these canvases in a mocked-up miro board of the Iasa canvases we will be covering in these articles here: [Miro | Online Whiteboard for Visual Collaboration](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVORNRx4s=/?share_link_id=155880042988).

I am looking forward to this Design Series based on the BTABoK. Here is my current thinking on the order they will come in:

~~1.      Dissecting Design – And Introduction - Done~~

~~2.      Options, Options, Options – So Many Choices - Done~~

~~3.      Decision Rights Rule the World – Why Agile Architecture is so Hard~~

~~4.      From Cornflower Blue Buttons to Architecturally Significant Requirements~~

5.      Views and *BEYOND* – Thinking, Facilitating, and Communicating

6.      I Like Patterns – Patterns, Reference Models, and Conformance

7.      Assessments, Tests, and Chasing Perfection – How Governance and Assessment are Different
