As the landscape of business and technology evolves, the role of Business Technology(BT) Architects becomes increasingly critical. To support the development of these professionals, Iasa Global has designed a comprehensive mentoring program.

### Structured Learning

The structured learning material defines the content of the mentoring relationship. Each pathway is broken out into a series of lessons, including a customized experience path for the mentee. Each lesson includes readings, case studies, practical exercises, and assessments to ensure a thorough understanding and application of the material. Lessons may include:

1. Reading materials - each structured mentoring lesson has gathered a set of required reading material. 
2. Mentor Circle meetings to discuss examples and materials. 
3. Self-paced videos and learning materials.

# Corporate Mentoring Programs

For organizations that need scaled mentoring through internal development, we have designed a mentoring program accreditation and management program. This program provides the ability to scale mentoring to where it belongs, directly into the workplace. The program requires three major components to be accredited by the BTABoK. 

- **Educated and Certified Mentors:** It is essential that mentors have the experience and competency to guide mentees in their learning tasks. Internal mentors need to achieve the appropriate education in the pathways they will be mentoring and must be able to achieve the Professional (CITA-P level) board certification within 1 year of becoming a mentor. 

- **Mentee Assignment Review:** For architects to gain the appropriate experience, they must be able to work on measured tasks. The employer must undergo a review of how mentees will be assigned work based on the BTABoK competency model tasks and assignment. 

- **Complete Mentee Documentation:** Architects grow in each phase of their career, thus mentors and mentees must be willing to show demonstrated work as a part of their architecture career record, the storage of their achieved and verified tasks and outcomes. This information is private to the employer and the mentee. 

## Corporate Mentoring Options

Different companies may want to achieve different levels of mentoring support. We have designed the corporate mentoring program to provide options for these employers so that it is as flexible as they need. 

1. **Level 1 Bronze Structured Mentoring Provider** - this level is to adopt the structure mentoring pathways within the organization. It is primarily a training/mentoring program based solely on the Iasa provided courses and learning pathways of the mentoring program. **Minimum 50 participants.**

2. **Level 2 Silver Experiential Mentoring Provider** - this level identifies organizations that want to adopt the structure mentoring program as well as go further into experiential mentoring. This level requires adapting the internal career path to allow architects to practice the competencies in their work assignments. **Minimum 100 participants. Architect career path review and accreditation**

3. **Level 3 Gold Distinguished Mentoring Provider** - this level identifies organizations that want to create acclaimed and globally visible mentoring programs. This level will fully adopt the BTABoK competencies, concepts and techniques and the organizaiton will commit to support the entire architecture career journey as well as to give back contribution to the body of knowledge. **Minimum 100 participants, career path review, and architecture practice review and accreditation.**
