# Legacy Systems Transformation

## Overview

The demands on business to meet customer needs are a key factor in maintaining competitiveness. A common challenge faced by business is the management, replacement, and decommissioning of legacy systems. What happens when your key IT systems just arenâ€™t keeping up with the demands of the business? Perhaps the system no longer fits with the business process and is too expensive to change, or the maintenance costs are seriously cutting into your profit margin. Perhaps it is a change in the direction or strategy of the business which means that the IT landscape needs to change.
