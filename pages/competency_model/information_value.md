(System/Person waiting/needing information)

**State 2:** Information realized as available\
(Raw Data formatted transposed into a useful format)

**State 3:** Knowledge gleaned and value created

### **Value of Information (VOI)**


### **VOI Processing**

**Considerations:**

-   Cost to store and make available for consumption

-   Cost to collect and analyze for trends, quality, duplicates
-   Savings in regards to all of the above when purchased

### **VOI Relevance**

**Considerations:**

-   Context in relation to the consumer
-   Support for decision making and/or problem resolution
-   Structure and format

### **VOI Exclusivity**

**Considerations:**

-   How many other sources exist?
-   What is being done to protect exclusivity?
-   What is the perception of the brand?

### **VOI Multipliers**

**Multipliers:**

-   Time since first available
-   Quality and accuracy
-   Respect and/or proven expertise in the domain

### **Why is VOI so controversial?**

**The value of information frequently starts disputes due to...?**

-   Information can often be produced at little or no cost.
-   Information may be either subjective or objective, or both at the same time.
-   Information may be totally false or true, partially false or true, or neither false nor true.
-   Information, unlike objects, cannot exist apart from value.

### **Information Value Summary**

-   Information can be exchanged for other information or money therefore it has value.
-   The value of information depends on its relevance, processing, and exclusivity from the consumers viewpoint.
-   VOI is often up for debate but when used to the fullest potential to make decisions, solve problems and/or create opportunities the value is more easily realized.
