Quality Attributes Pillar
=========================

For quality attributes, it appears that we worry about incorporating certain quality attributes into our solutions but do not seem very concerned with how they will be monitored. In general, we don't seem to care about how solutions will be managed, maintained, and will sunset at end of life. This is especially interesting as 20 percent of the cost of a solution occurs during design and delivery and 80 percent is spent in maintenance over the life of the solution.
