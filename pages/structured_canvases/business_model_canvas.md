| Area                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Links To                                                        |

| Key Partners (also Suppliers) | Who do we do business with that makes our value proposition successful?                                                                                                                                                             | N/A                                                             |
| Key Activities                | Key activities are the actions (verb/noun) that are critical to the effectiveness of the value proposition.                                                                                                                         | Business Capabilities Canvas (identifies critical capabilities) |
| Key Resources                 | Resources are the assets (like warehouses and distribution systems for Amazon) that directly impact the value model.                                                                                                                | N/A                                                             |
| Value Proposition             | Probably the most important area of the canvas. This is not a list of our products but the actual value we create for our customers. Good example was the iPod, "A seamless music experience"                                       | N/A                                                             |
| Customer Relationships        | Possibly the hardest of the areas, customer relationships are WHY our customers stay with our value proposition. For example, if a person has a large number of books on the Amazon Kindle they will likely not use another eReader | Customer Personas, Empathy Maps                                 |
| Channels                      | The marketing, distribution and delivery of our products or services.                                                                                                                                                               | Customer Journey(s), Service Blueprint(s)                       |
| Customer Segments             | The Customers and their groupings we are serving. The best use of these come from marketing customer segments and then a real customer.                                                                                             | Customer Persona(s)                                             |
| Costs                         | The critical cost factors impacting the business model                                                                                                                                                                              | Cost Risk Card                                                  |
| Revenues                      | The critical revenue factors impacting the business model                                                                                                                                                                           | Benefits Realization Article, Benefits Card                     |
