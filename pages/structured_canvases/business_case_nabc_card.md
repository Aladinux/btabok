The Business Case has many names and uses. However, it primarily provides the details of a certain amount of work and it's expected benefits and costs. The BTABoK uses the NABC template (Need, Approach, Benefits, Considerations) as a Lean Business Case template which can be seen on a single page. It may still be necessary to use a larger document which will be added as another 'canvas' to the BTABoK though it will be in document formats.
