Objectives are one of the key areas to understanding business outcomes in the BTABoK. The Objective Key Result card represents a single objective which can be measured against a set of key results. The [Objectives article](../engagement_model/objectives.md) describes how to define and understand objectives. The OKR card should be used to understand impacts to the business model through strategy setting and benefits analysis.
