## Strategic Roadmap Canvas (Visual)

The strategic roadmap canvas is a tool to bring together the architects view on multiple streams of work. This can be likened to the portfolio or program level in traditional project management but serves a different function for architects. The goal of this canvas is to bring together the strategic nature of the projects/products being delivered and how they depend on each other.

## Strategic Roadmap Card (Descriptive)

The strategic roadmap card provides a description of a portfolio or top level strategic view of a set of initiatives, produce/projects or activities. It can be combined.with strategy scorecards and other Strategy tools to define a direction and set of objectives.

The vision is often expressed as a short textual statement, providing a description of what is to be achieved and why.

For example:

1. "Company X is an established provider of flat sheet steel throughout Europe and is a primary supplier to the automobile industry."
2. "The logistics department will provide the company with an exceptional service which can ensure delivery of goods to all customers in the UK within 2 days."
