The strategic roadmap canvas provides a description of a portfolio or top level strategic view of a set of initiatives, produce/projects or activities. It can be combined.with strategy scorecards and other Strategy tools to define a direction and set of objectives.

The vision is often expressed as a short textual statement, providing a description of what is to be achieved and why.

For example:

1.  "Company X is an established provider of flat sheet steel throughout Europe and is a primary supplier to the automobile industry."
2.  "The logistics department will provide the company with an exceptional service which can ensure delivery of goods to all customers in the UK within 2 days."
