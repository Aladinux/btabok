| Time___             | Insert timeframes in some similar format such as months or quarters. Often times are shorter closer to the beginning and longer on the far right.                                                                                              | N/A                    |
| Events              | The events section should show milestones, market events or outcomes. Things like 'version 1 available to public' or '10,000 users on the system'. Also compliance or external events can be shown here such as GDPR or other external events. | N/A                    |
| Business            | Business features, capabilities or processes should be shown in the business lane. A feature such as login or shopping cart or another functional area.                                                                                        | ASR                    |
| Technology          | Technology support components are technical services or products which support features. Using an authentication provider or a security framework would support login.                                                                         | Context View, ASR, ADR |
| People and Learning | The people needed or what they need to learn. Training, pilots, or other learning methods go here.                                                                                                                                             |                        |
| Linking (between)   | Generally arrows connecting components on the roadmap indicate dependencies (if going down) or enablement (if going up). These are optional.                                                                                                   |                        |
