# Architecturally Significant Requirements

Architecturally significant requirements is a term used in the BTABoK to describe a set of concepts which relate to the development and delivery of value to an organization. Architecturally significant requirements can be broken into several different factors, depending on how the engagement model is implemented.

Requirements are recognized and developed throughout the entire portfolio of the enterprise. The goal of which is to represent value streams across the enterprise and to trace those value streams through the decision making process. Traditional architecturally significant requirements are mapped to innovation and ideation, business case development, project and or product requirements, epics and stories. And represent needs from both business and technology leadership.

For the purpose of the BTABoK, all thinking, ideas and desires about a business or technology system can be characterized as requirements, though depending on the full engagement model in use by an organization they may be called other names and use other format.
