# Adopting the BTABoK Competency Model

The BTABoK competency model was established to provide guidance and management of architects in their careers and serve as a shared competency management tool for organizations that employ architects. The competency model is based on years of research from practicing architects and creates a stable base for employing, educating and working with architects of all types.

To move to the BTABoK Competency Model an organization will need to take care to think through all of the career implications internally and externally for employees, HR, hiring and career path planning. In addition, it is essential to take into account external certifications, training and how they link into the career growth of the employee and the organization. This guide will help an organization accomplish the primary planning activities and provide useful guidelines in the adoption process.

This document will focus on the adoption of the BTABoK Competency Model. There are other elements of using the BTABoK for employees and for the practices such as Architect Mentoring, the Structured Canvas Approach and Stakeholder Driven Architecture. These are addressed in other documents on this site.

## The Competency Model

The BTABoK Competency Model describes the critical competencies of all architects. It is based on similar efforts in medicine, building architecture and other professions. The BTABoK is unique in the industry as it creates a very clear value proposition for architects, builds specializations on top of a shared body of knowledge and set of competencies, and is completely independent of particular implementations, techniques and frameworks. In addition, the BTABoK Competency Model is adaptable to special areas of knowledge which are specific to a particular architecture specialization, technique, or even technologies and architecture style.

The competency model is broken out into the following concepts.

-   Every competency can be displayed in 5 levels from awareness to mastery. This is taken from Bloom's Taxonomy and mapped to Iasa Certifications.
-   Every competency includes multiple skills (individually measurable learning/demonstration areas)
-   Competencies can relate to a knowledge/practice Concept from the BTABoK (or elsewhere). The relationship between the two is that one is a practical tool for an entire practice and one is a measurable competency for a person.
-   Moving from one level of mastery to another requires both knowledge and experience in all but the case of awareness.

### The Principles

The career path is based on the following principles:

1.  All specializations should share a set of competencies that differentiate the profession.
2.  All architects should acquire and retain a percentage of these competencies.
3.  No architect is able to achieve perfectly even scores across all competencies.
4.  The competencies are grouped into competency groups that are similar in nature.
5.  Technology, architecture styles, architecture tools, and platforms are not competencies.
6.  There is a level of scope at which an architect cannot retain their proactive activities but instead become management.

The principles should guide decisions related to titles, competencies and career path and may be rolled out over time.

### The 5 Pillars

The 5 pillars (competency groups) are:

1.  Business Technology Strategy - this pillar forms the baseline of the profession of business technology architecture. BTS is the application of business and technical competencies to create outcomes for architect clients.
2.  Design - this pillar includes all of the competencies necessary to understand a problem or requirement space and design an effective solution to meet it.
3.  Human Dynamics - this pillar includes the people skills necessary to achieve change through groups of human stakeholders, users, clients, and customers/beneficiaries.
4.  Quality Attributes - this pillar includes knowledge of the cross-cutting systemic qualities and properties which emerge from complex systems.
5.  IT Environment - this pillar includes the competencies related to creating, developing, managing, testing, and running technology systems.

Combined the 5 pillars make an architect. Specialization is built on top.

### Specializations

Using specializations is hard in architecture practices. The idea of a specialization is that it is large enough to be constant throughout the profession, has a competencies based on the five pillars and does not significantly overlap with another specialization. There are dozens and maybe hundreds of job titles in the marketplace which makes the task even harder. The BTABoK currently recognizes 5 specialization areas for architects. The acronym for these is BIISS.

-   Business - the specialization most focused on creating business outcomes, working with business strategy and providing the cornerstone of business technology strategy. Note: the primary difference between BTABoK Business Architects and other definitions is that the BTABoK business architects maintain a degree of technology excellence (from the 5 pillars) throughout their careers. This allows buiness architects to interact and be seen as part of the other architect specializations which may be more technically focused.
-   Information - the specialization which deals with information as strategy. This specialization focuses on information usage, transformation, transmission, storage and retrieval. It is most often associated with usability, integration and/or data.
-   Infrastructure - this specialization deals most often with the operations and running of platforms which support the IT environment. It involves the overlap between operations, data center (or cloud), compute, storage, network as well as future facing roles in IoT, product and edge-compute.
-   Software - this specialization deals primarily with the development and engineering of complex software systems and the outcomes of those systems.
-   Solution - this 'specialization' is actually a generalization of the previous specializations with a focus on delivery of value within a product/project or other change initiative. It most commonly is related to the delivery of larger, more complex solutions.

To map specializations it is necessary to decide titles and roles. It is not necessary to support all specializations directly and it is likely that some roles will be called by other names, however the more rigorous about specialization and what it means the easier and less confusing the titles will be.

## Goals of the Change

As with all architecture activities, it is important to establish the objectives of the change. The BTABoK was founded with the notion of developing a World-Class Architecture Practice and these objectives roll up into it. There are any number of potential benefits to using an external professional career path for architects and they should be measured along with the change.

1.  Stabilize Hiring and Employment
2.  Standardize Skill Measurement
3.  Decrease the Cost of Hiring
4.  Increase Employee Retention and Job Satisfaction
5.  Make Career Growth Repeatable

## Establishing A Plan

The competency model itself is relatively straightforward. However, adoption should be a part of a plan including stakeholders, level of adoption and approach.

1.  Map existing job description/role to competencies.
2.  Decide specializations if supporting.
3.  Match internal HR Levels to Competencies and Career Levels.
4.  Decide on Measurement methods to use and measure existing architects/extended team.
5.  Setting Up Job Descriptions
6.  Describe the Career Path and how to move between levels.
7.  Describe how hiring will use the model for evaluating.

### Mapping Job Descriptions

Extract the competencies in the current job description/role requirement. Competencies do not include specific technologies. For example: Be able to program C\# at a senior level is not a competency. Engineering and Coding Software is a competency. Take the current measures for job performance and map them against the BTABoK 5 pillars. Take notes on the current levels and how those are covered in the competencies. Attempt to match missing competencies or save them to use within specialization. Review the competency skills to see if left over competencies are already mapped to an a BTABoK competency.

### Note: Enterprise, Domain, and Product Architects

The BTABoK does not recognize these as specializations as they either refer to Scope (see BTABoK definitions) or a particular knowledge area or technology (such as Cloud or Azure). Scopes make bad titles and specializations because no unique competency can be found within the specialization. However, it is possible to use Domain or Enterprise as an extension of seniority to solution architects though it appears that it creates negative outcomes in many organizations.

To understand how to deal with Scope (link) and domain (which is a scope in BTABoK) as a title it is important to understand the relationship between scope and seniority. For example, in medicine, while a chief of medicine oversees and mentors less senior (less capable) doctors, they still very much see patients. It is important when using scope as a distinguishing factor in titles that seniority is not implied and that the higher levels of scope do not result in loss of competencies. The hierarchical relationship between enterprise architects and solution architects is seen as an anti-pattern. Instead, the BTABoK recommends the use of chief architect or principal architect titles to represent seniority, and scope is applied to specialization or domain area. Principe Software Architect for 'Domain Area' for example.

### Match HR Levels

HR Levels are those internal markers for achieving new pay grades, seniority or other benefits. In the BTABoK these should not be achievable simply through promotion for architects but at least at critical levels be based on outside measurements (certifications) and internal mentoring. However, this is often a difficult task in the modern company.

It is possible to have multiple HR Levels mapped to a single external certification level. For example, CITA-Professional level may be augmented with a Princple Architect level inside of the company. This mapping should be relatively easy to accomplish.

### Measure Architects

Measuring architects involves two aspects, one is measuring the baseline of an architects competencies, two involves showing growth in those competencies over time. The goal of these measurements is to get as reasonable an estimate as possible of the exact level of the architects knowledge, experience and abilities within that competency as possible (true exactness in this is not possible).

There are 4 ways to measure competency:

1.  Self assessment: the professional measures their own competencies against the competency model.
2.  Peer assessment: the professional is measured by what others have seen them do from the outside (t)
3.  Direct mentoring: a mentor to the professional provides direct feedback on the level that a professional has learned or demonstrated to them.
4.  Certification: the professional is measured against an internal or external certification process based on the competency model.

These measurements are used to feedback to the organization on the level of the professional. When Iasa describes '360 degree' measurements it is assumed that all 4 types will be used. It is possible to get started successfully, though a little confusing to the professionals, with the simpler peer and self-assessments.

### Competencies and Job Descriptions

### Managing a Career Path

### Growing Competencies

The ultimate goal of the competency model is helping to ensure that individual architects are prepared to do the job at the correct level and are able to grow their competencies without undue risk to the organization and to projects.
